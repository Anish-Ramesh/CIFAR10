# CIFAR-10 Image Classification Model

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built using TensorFlow/Keras for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a popular benchmark dataset in computer vision, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that accurately classifies images into one of the ten classes in the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is designed with simplicity in mind while maintaining high performance.

## Key Features:
#### Dataset: CIFAR-10, which includes classes such as airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.
Model Architecture: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, optimized for image classification tasks.
#### Training: The model is trained on 50,000 images and evaluated on a separate test set of 10,000 images.
Performance Metrics: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix metrics.

## Installation and Setup
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cifar10-classification.git
cd cifar10-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
How to Use
Training the Model:

Run the training script to train the model from scratch. The model architecture is defined in model.py.

python train.py

## Making Predictions:
Use the saved model to make predictions on new images or the test dataset.

python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg

## Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy of approximately 81% on the test set.
Model Optimization: Experiment with different architectures, regularization techniques, and hyperparameters to improve accuracy.
Data Augmentation: Incorporate data augmentation techniques to make the model more robust to variations in the input data.
